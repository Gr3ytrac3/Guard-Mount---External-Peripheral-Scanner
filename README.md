## What is GuardMount?

**GuardMount** is a next-generation Linux security tool that intercepts all external peripheral devices (USBs, HDDs, BadUSB devices) **at the kernel level before they can mount**, scans their content for malicious payloads, and **requires explicit user authorization to proceed**.

Unlike traditional USB scanners that react **after** the device mounts, **GuardMount acts as a gatekeeper, blocking auto-mount events through custom UDEV rules**. It ensures that no device touches your filesystem without passing an in-depth threat analysis — effectively eliminating split-second payload execution vectors.

---

## Why Pre-Mount Interception Matters

Modern attack vectors (BadUSB, Rubber Ducky payloads, autorun scripts) can exploit devices **the moment they are mounted**. A fraction of a second is enough to:

* Trigger silent autorun scripts
* Inject malicious HID commands
* Execute stealthy firmware payloads

GuardMount stops this by:

* **Intercepting kernel mount events (via UDEV control)**
* Scanning the device **before** the system interacts with it
* Giving you the final say to allow, deny, or quarantine the device

---

## Core Features

✅ **Kernel-Level Device Interception (UDEV Rule Integration)**

✅ **Blocks Auto-Mount Until Scan & Authorization**

✅ **Rubber Ducky & HID Attack Prevention**

✅ **Full Content Analysis using ClamAV + Heuristic Rules**

✅ **Persistent Device Fingerprinting (Serial, VID/PID Check)**

✅ **Terminal-Based Threat Report & User Prompt**

✅ **Mount Devices Only After Approval (Read-Only Mode by Default)**

✅ **Systemd Integration for Persistent Background Monitoring**

## Installation & Setup

### Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Linux (Ubuntu, Kali, Arch, etc.)
* [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/)
* Python Packages:

  * `pyudev`, `psutil`, `clamd`, `rich`, `colorama`

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Install ClamAV
sudo apt install clamav clamav-daemon -y
sudo freshclam  # Update virus definitions

# Clone GuardMount Repository
git clone https://github.com/Gr3ytrac3/Guard-Mount---External-Peripheral-Scanner.git
cd guard-mount

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### UDEV Lockdown Setup

```bash
# Copy GuardMount's UDEV rule to block automount for USB storage
sudo cp system/99-guardmount.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

# Reload UDEV rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

---

## Running GuardMount

```bash
sudo python3 guard-mount/main.py
```

GuardMount will now control all external storage devices — detecting, scanning, and authorizing them **before they reach your system**.

---

## Optional: Install as a Systemd Daemon

```bash
# Copy service file
sudo cp system/guard-mount.service /etc/systemd/system/

# Enable and start the service
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl enable guard-mount
sudo systemctl start guard-mount
```

Check status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status guard-mount
```
